## R Packages

We will be focusing on the R packages [warbleR](https://marce10.github.io/warbleR/), [ohun](https://marce10.github.io/ohun/), [Rraven](https://marce10.github.io/Rraven/) and [PhenotypeSpace](https://marce10.github.io/PhenotypeSpace/) for preparing our acoustic data and quantifying the structure of sounds. 

Note that the packages [ohun](https://marce10.github.io/ohun/) and [PhenotypeSpace](https://marce10.github.io/PhenotypeSpace/) haven't been submitted to CRAN yet (nov 7 2022) and must be installed from github.

The latest version of the packages needed to run the code can be installed as follows:

``` r
remotes::install_github("maRce10/Rraven")
remotes::install_github("maRce10/warbleR")
remotes::install_github("maRce10/ohun")
remotes::install_github("maRce10/PhenotypeSpace")


```
